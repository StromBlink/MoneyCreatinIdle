To use the post processing : juste download the post processing stack on the asset store,
it's free! 
Then just go in the 04-Post-Processing Profile folder to find the profile I used and link it to your camera (add component, post processing behaviour)

You can drag and drop the prefab directly into your scene. 

When you deplace and rotate the prefabs in to scene, use the snap by pressing ctrl.

The snap settings can be found in the edit menu, use 5 5 5 : x y z to snap the assets correctly.

You can create new materials and play with it or use those already in the project : LowPolyCity_Vol.2-Skyscrapers\Assets\LowPolyCity_Vol.2-Skyscrapers\01-Assets\03-Models\Materials
